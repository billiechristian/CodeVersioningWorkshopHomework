## What is Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become one of the most widely used version control systems in the world. Git allows developers to work on their code locally, making it easy to experiment with new features and fixes without affecting the main codebase. It also allows developers to collaborate with others by sharing their changes and merging them into a single codebase.

Git is designed to be fast, efficient, and flexible. It uses a simple and powerful branching model that allows developers to work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously. It also provides a rich set of tools for managing code changes, including the ability to revert changes, view commit history, and resolve conflicts. Git is an essential tool for any developer who wants to work on a project with others or keep track of their own code changes over time.

### Below are some fundamental Git commands
- git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
- git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
- git add: Adds changes to the staging area.
- git commit: Commits changes to the local repository.
- git status: Shows the status of the working directory and staging area.
- git log: Shows the commit history of the repository.
- git branch: Lists all branches in the repository.
- git checkout: Switches to a different branch or commit.
- git merge: Merges changes from one branch into another.
- git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the local repository.
- git push: Pushes changes from the local repository to a remote repository.
